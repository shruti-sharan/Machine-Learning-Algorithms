There are four python files , one containing each model- MLP, MLP without activation, CNN and CNN without activation.
These files run with python3 and the system should have all the related libraries such as torch, torchvision, matplotlib etc installed.
For the CNN files, GPU is recommended. The code is written to incorporate gpu training by setting the device to CUDA and read the images accordingly.
